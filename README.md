# My Web Project - Code from Free Code Camp

This is a simple web project that includes an HTML file and a CSS file.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for the web project.
- `css/styles.css`: This is the main CSS file for the web project.
- `README.md`: This is the documentation for the project.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the web page.
3. To edit the styles, open the `css/styles.css` file in a text editor.

## Usage

To use the project, you can edit the `index.html` and `css/styles.css` files to suit your needs. The `index.html` file defines the structure of the web page, and the `css/styles.css` file defines the styles for the elements in the HTML file.
